<!--
    THE USER INTERFACE

* When the user clicksÂ New Game, the letters are revealed and she can begin 
  typing words.
* The letters are presented as little "chips" (I am going to refer to these 
  things as chips throughout the assignment).
* Each letter chip contains a smaller chip indicating its points value.
* As the user types, the page provides continuous feedback. Specifically, 
  if the word she is currently typing contains any letters that are not allowed, 
  then the disallowed letters appear as red chips underneath the textbox.
* If the user tries to submit (presses Enter after typing) a word that contains 
  disallowed letters, then the textbox simply clears and the word is not submitted.
* Once the user does submit a word containing only valid letters, it appears in a 
  chip below the textbox.
* Shortly after a word chip appears, it will sprout a smaller (blue or red) 
  chip indicating the points total for the word. A normal word will contain a blue 
  chip with a number indicating its score. But a gibberish, nonexistent word will 
  instead contain a red chip with an "X".
* Once the timer runs out, the textbox is no longer usable.
